The Phoenix Group (formerly Pearl Group, LSE: PHNX) is one of the largest providers of insurance services in the United Kingdom. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.


== History ==
The Company was founded in 1857 as The Pearl Loan Company and operated from the Royal Oak Public House opposite the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. It changed its name to The Pearl Assurance Company in 1914, when it moved to 252 High Holborn where it was based until moving its head office to Peterborough 1989. In 1990, it was acquired by the Australian insurance group, AMP, and then in 2003, Pearl, NPI and London Life were demerged from AMP to become part of Henderson Group.
In 2005, the Pearl Group was bought from Henderson Group by Sun Capital Partners (a business in which Hugh Osmond is a leading partner) and TDR Capital. It acquired Resolution Life in 2008 (including its Phoenix Assurance operations). In 2009, the business was acquired by the Liberty Acquisition Holdings (International) Company (a vehicle controlled by billionaire Nicolas Berggruen), which subsequently renamed itself Pearl Group.
In 2010, Pearl Group changed its name to Phoenix Group Holdings. In March 2014, the business sold Ignis Asset Management to Standard Life Investments, the asset management arm of Standard Life.
