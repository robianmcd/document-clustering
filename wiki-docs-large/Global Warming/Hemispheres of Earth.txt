The Hemispheres of Earth in geography and cartography refer to any division of the globe into two hemispheres (from Ancient Greek  hmisphairion meaning "half of a sphere").
The most common such divisions are by latitudinal or longitudinal markers: 
North-South
Northern Hemisphere, the half that lies north of the equator
Southern Hemisphere, the half that lies south of the equator

East-West
Eastern Hemisphere, the half that lies east of the prime meridian and west of the 180th meridian
Western Hemisphere, the half that lies west of the prime meridian and east of the 180th meridian

The East-West division can also be seen in a cultural sense, as a division into two cultural hemispheres.
However, other schemes have sought to divide the planet in a way that maximizes the preponderance of one geographic feature or another in each division:
Land-Water Land Hemisphere, the hemisphere on Earth containing the largest possible area of land
Water Hemisphere, the hemisphere on Earth containing the largest area of water
