Mobile journalism is an emerging form of new media storytelling where reporters use portable electronic devices with network connectivity to gather, edit and distribute news from his or her community.
Such reporters, sometimes known as mojos (for mobile journalist), are staff or freelance journalists who may use digital cameras and camcorders, laptop PCs, smartphones or tablet devices. A broadband wireless connection or cellular phone network is then used to transmit the story and imagery for publication. The term mojo has been in use since 2005, originating at the Fort Myers News-Press, then gaining popularity throughout the Gannett newspaper chain in the United States.
