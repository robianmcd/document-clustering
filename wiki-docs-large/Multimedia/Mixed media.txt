In visual art, mixed media is an artwork in which more than one medium has been employed.
When creating a painted or photographed work using mixed media care is taken to allow enough drying time between the layers to ensure the final work will have structural integrity. If many different media are used it is equally important to choose a sturdy foundation upon which the different layers are imposed.
Many effects can be achieved by using mixed media. Found objects can be used in conjunction with traditional artist media to attain a wide range of self-expression. Some children's picture books also use mixed media illustrations. For example, 's Nachts by Wolf Erlbruch.
Mixed media art, a visual art, is distinguished from multimedia art which combines visual art with non-visual elements, such as recorded sound, literature, drama, dance, motion graphics, music, or interactivity.
